# FRIENDS app using Ruby on Rails
This is a simple friends web application created using the Ruby on Rails framework and styled using bootstrap. The users can create their profiles and fill up a form which will then add the names and details of their friends. The users can even edit their profile and delete their friends. </br>
Sadly, the app isn't hosted :( but no worries, you can still clone this repo and check the app out on your local machine, just follow the steps below :D

# Tools Used
Ruby version 2.7.1</br>
Rails version 6.1.2</br>
Checkout all the dependencies along with their versions in the gemfile

# Getting Started
Make sure you have the same ruby and rails versions as mine. </br>
Just clone this repository on your local machine and run **bundle install --without production** on your terminal. After this, all the dependencies will be installed to your project and you can run it locally by running **rails s** command from your terminal.
